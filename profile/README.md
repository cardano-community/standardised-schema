**A Hub for community projects across Cardano ecosystem to host their repositories under single umbrella**

Everyone is welcome to host their open-source repository while maintaining their own permissions, credits, and methodologies.


The aim to have this org account is simply to make it easier for community projects to be held together and collaborate better as ecosystem. Understandably, not everyone may find it suitable for their use - but the idea is to not have stale repositories that are not maintained to be lost forever or have to be forked as the maintainers may often move on to other tasks gradually.

PS: We're still in learning phase and only trying to make things as easy as possible to hold together, and welcome suggestions to make things better.

To-Do for org maintainance:

 - Add initial projects  
 - Prepare onboarding documentations  
 - Update entry pages to provide listing of repositories and primary authors  
 - Set up templates
